  "description": "In the hot spring town of Yugawara, not far from Tokyo, Mitsuru Kadono runs a handyman business. An avid smoker, he harbors a unique secret: through the smoke of his cigarettes, he can hear the inner voices of others. Whether it's weeding gardens, giving tours, or offering life advice, Kadono listens to these unspoken thoughts as he supports the townspeople in their daily lives. And so, with a calm demeanor and wisps of smoke curling around him, he continues his quiet, reflective work.",
